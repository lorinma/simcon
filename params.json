{"name":"Simcon","tagline":"Simulation of construction workflow","body":"# Simcon - simulation of construction workflow\r\nThis is an open source (LGPL) academic project for agent-based workflow simulation of construction process.\r\nIt is written in python 2.7, all the simulation setup data are pulled from google spreadsheet, and the program will try to upload the simulation result to the same spreadsheet. \r\n\r\nBut anyway, each round of the simulation will generate a csv file for local backup of the result\r\n\r\n## Dependencies:\r\n\r\n### First:\r\non Mac: conda install pyopenssl\r\n\r\non Ubuntu: apt-get install -y --force-yes --no-install-recommends python-openssl libssl-dev libffi-dev\r\n\r\n### Then:\r\npip install gspread numpy pandas oauth2client cryptography\r\n\r\npip install -U https://github.com/RandomOrg/JSON-RPC-Python/zipball/master       \r\n\r\npip install -U https://github.com/google/google-visualization-python/zipball/master\r\n\r\n## Spreadsheet and other setup\r\n### Spreadsheet:\r\nIt requires a credential files to use data on google spreadsheet\r\n\r\n(see http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html?highlight=oauth) \r\n\r\nNotice: The file should be named as OAuth2Credentials.json and placed in the root of this project\r\n\r\nBesides the instruction above, also need to add a line to OAuth2Credentials.json about the Key of the target spreadsheet like: \"sheet_id\": \"xxxxxx\",\r\n\r\nNotice: make sure the sheet you provide is shared with email address with write right\r\n### Random number generator:\r\nThis project uses https://www.random.org/ to generate true random numbers\r\n\r\nYou need to add a line to OAuth2Credentials.json about your Key of RandomOrgClient like \"random_org_key\": \"xxxx\",\r\n\r\n(see https://www.random.org/clients/http/) \r\n\r\nif the number of api usage is used out, the program will use general random number generator\r\n\r\n## Run the simulation\r\n\r\npython game.py\r\n","google":"UA-65884503-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
